### Course Description (from Peter Kellner)

React versions 16.8 and higher, include React Hooks which solve several problems that went unaddressed in previous versions. React Hooks provide a direct API to React concepts you already know about. Those concepts include props, state, context, refs and lifecycle events. React Hooks are designed for use in React Functional Components where previously there was no good way to manage state or lifecycle events.

In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to use the top seven React Hooks as well as gain the knowledge and experience necessary to build your own customized composite Hook. Along the way, youâ€™ll pick up techniques you can use building real world web apps that include how React Hooks can help you with REST services, reducers, authentication and more.

When you are finished with this course, youâ€™ll confidently be able to combine functional components with React Hooks to build first class React apps. Those apps can be written completely with functional components and React Hooks.
